            <h2>Artist's Statement</h2>

            <div class="text-box">
                <p>My goal is to make images which are not necessarily beautiful but rather reflective.</p>
                <p>I crave an active and diverse viewing experience.</p>
                <p>The mark you see is not a branch - it's a mark, it's a movement, it's an impression, it's a pathway. Except when that same mark is a branch. The mark is a branch and everything else that shape could depict, it's a branch and nothing else those shapes might depict.</p>
                <p>The images come instinctually through a practice of replicating East Asian ink painting techniques - a replication of a replication of a replication.</p>

        <h2>About Scott</h2>
        <div class="text-box">
          <p>I'm an artist working out of Tokyo, Japan. I have a B.A. from Clark University in Studio Art.</p>
          <p>My work is heavily influenced and concerned with East Asian brush painting, stemming my time spent living in Japan studying Japanese language, culture, and art.</p>
          <p>I use elements and techniques found in traditional brush painting and apply them in a way which is not instantly recognizable in an effort to bring out traditional ink painting's innate contemporary qualities.</p>
